## Resources

A list of useful resources for a modern, transparent, and reproducible scientific workflow. These resources cover many stages of the scientific process from designing an experimental procedure to writing a report and collaborating with others. This list will be continuously updated.

### Open science, a transparent, and reproducible workflow

#### Preregistration and registered reports

- The preregistration revolution (Nosek et al., [2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600))
- What are [registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/)? 

#### Version control and automation, a reproducible workflow

- A Tutorial on the Git Version Control System (Vuorre & Curley, [2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245918754826))
- RStudio, Git and Github (Wickham, [2015](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html))

#### Data collection (sensitivity and sequential analyses)

How should we determine the sample size of our study? Do we have to do it a priori or can we stop recruitment when we have sufficient evidence to conclude?

- When power analyses based on pilot data are biased (Albers & Lakens, [2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002210311630230X))
- At what sample size do correlations stabilize? (Schönbrodt & Perugini, [2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656613000858))
- Sequential hypothesis testing with Bayes factors: Efficiently testing mean differences (Schönbrodt, Wagenmakers, Zehetleitner, & Perugini, [2017](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-56330-001)).
- BFDA Bayes factor design analysis: <https://github.com/nicebread/BFDA>
- A fully automatised, transparent, reproducible and blind protocol for sequential analyses (Beffara Bret, Beffara Bret, & Nalborczyk, [2021](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/869/2461)).

#### Large-scale collaborations

To counter the pervasive problem of low-powered experimental designs, researchers started to pool efforts to provide high-powered responses to debated questions in psychological researchers as well as to assess the generalisability of the findings. The idea is pretty simple: instead of running a single study in our lab, what if we could run the study in (let's say) 20 different labs all across the world?

- Many-labs initiatives, such [many lab (1 to 5)](https://osf.io/89vqh/), [many primates](https://manyprimates.github.io), [many babies](https://manybabies.github.io), etc.
- [Study-swap](https://osf.io/meetings/studyswap/): a research community for sharing resources and collaborations
- The Psychological Science Accelerator ([2018's paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918797607))
